# .NET Microservices Boilerplate

[![fluentpos](https://github.com/fullstackhero/dotnet-microservices-boilerplate/actions/workflows/fluentpos-cicd.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/fullstackhero/dotnet-microservices-boilerplate/actions/workflows/fluentpos-cicd.yaml)

The goal is to build a framework that can make building microservices in .NET easy for developers. This project follows Vertical Slice Architecture and is built using Dapr as the core framework, along with other latest best practices and tools like CQRS, NoSQL, SQL, MediatR, Serilog, FluentValidations and more.üöÄ

## Goals

- :sparkle: Using `Vertical Slice Architecture` for architecture level.
- :sparkle: Using `Dapr` building blocks for microservice development and communication.
- :sparkle: Using `Domain Driven Design (DDD)` to implement all business processes in microservices.
- :sparkle: Using `Rabbitmq` on top of `Dapr` for `Event Driven Architecture` between our microservices.
- :sparkle: Using `CQRS` implementation with `MediatR` library.
- :sparkle: Using `Entity Framework Core` for some microservices.
- :sparkle: Using `MongoDB` for some microservices.
- :sparkle: Using `Fluent Validation` and a `Validation Pipeline Behaviour` on top of `MediatR`.
- :sparkle: Using `Minimal API` for all endpoints.
- :sparkle: Using `Health Check` for reporting the health of app infrastructure components.
- :sparkle: Using `Tye` for local development and debugging.
- :sparkle: Using `Built-In Containerization` for `Docker` images.
- :sparkle: Using `Zipkin` for distributed tracing.
- :sparkle: Using `OpenIddict` for authentication and authorization base on `OpenID-Connect` and `OAuth2`.
- :sparkle: Using `Yarp` as a microservices gateway.

## FluentPos

FluentPos is a sample project that consumes the microservice framework. You will learn a lot by exploring this project, which is located under the `./fluentpos` folder.

## How to Run ?

### Tye
Tye is a super-awesome way to run your applications quickly. The `fluentpos` project already has this support. Simply run the following at the `./fluentpos` directory :

```
make tye
```

That's it! 

This will spin up all the services required. 
- Gateway will be available on `https://localhost:7002`.
- Identity Service will be available on `https://localhost:7001`.
- Catalog Service will be available on `https://localhost:7003`.

To Test these APIs, you can use open up Visual Code from the `./fluentpos` directory, install the `Thunder Client` extension. I have already included the required Test collections at `./fluentpos/thunder-tests`.

> You can find the specification of services under the ./fluentpos/tye.yaml file.
### Docker & Docker-Compose
The `fluentpos` project comes included with the required docker-compose.yaml and makefile file for your reference.

There are some prerequisites for using these included docker-compose.yml files:

1) Make sure you have docker installed (on windows install docker desktop)

2) Create and install an https certificate:

    ```
    dotnet dev-certs https -ep $env:USERPROFILE\.aspnet\https\cert.pfx -p password!
    ```

    Note that the certificate name and password should match the ones that are mentioned in the docker-compose.yaml file.

3) It's possible that the above step gives you an `A valid HTTPS certificate is already present` error.
   In that case you will have to run the following command, and then  `Re-Run Step #2`.

    ```
     dotnet dev-certs https --clean
    ```

4) Trust the certificate

    ```
     dotnet dev-certs https --trust
    ```
Once your certificate is trusted, simply navigate into the `./fluentpos` folder of the project and run the following command.

```
make docker-up
```

This will spin up all the containers required. Your Gateway URL will be available on `https://localhost:7002`.

To bring down all the `fluentpos` container, simply run the following.

```
make docker-down
```

*Note that the default Docker Images that will be pulled are from my public Image Repository (for eg, `iammukeshm/fluentpos.identity:latest`). You can switch it your variants if required.*
